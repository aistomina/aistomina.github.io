            My name is Anna and I am a Web and New Media Design student. This is my third semester at the Academy, and I have
            enjoyed every minute of it. I enjoy swimming, yoga, reading and watching sci-fi, and spending time in Adobe
            Illustrator. I enjoy traveling to new places. In fact, I just got back from Alaska Monday night, and dove straight
            into writing this html document - a pretty neat way to kick-off the semester.

            I’m interested in html because it’s the basis for web design. I’d like to be able to create relatively simple
            websites without relying on html editors. When I “grow up” I’d like to become a UX designer, and be able to create
            working prototypes of the pages I design. I have talked to some UX designers, and was told it is a great skill to
            have to secure a job. And I can’t imagine being a web designer without having some html/CSS skills.
