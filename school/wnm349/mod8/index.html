        <h2>Who is Pusheen</h2>
        <p>Pusheen is a cartoon cat who is the subject of comic strips and sticker sets on Facebook.
          Pusheen Cat was created in 2010 by Claire Belton and Andrew Duff for a comic strip on their website,
          Everyday Cute. The original comic strip series included characters modeled after Belton, Duff, their dog named
          Care, and Pusheen, a chubby gray tabby cat based on Belton's parents' cat. Its name stems from the Irish word
          puis√≠n, which means kitten in Irish. When the "I am Pusheen Cat" book released, it sold out.

          Pusheen has become well known for appearing in sticker sets on Facebook. On Facebook, stickers are images that can
          be attached to personal messages or comments. The feature, including a set of Pusheen stickers, was introduced to iOS
          in April 2013, and added to the main website in July of the same year.[3] In an article for PC Magazine on emoji
          and unicode, Sascha Segan referred to Pusheen as Facebook's "proprietary emoji", being used as a form of vendor lock-in
