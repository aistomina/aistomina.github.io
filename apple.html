    Since March 2019 I've been working on data-driven web applications for desktop and mobile. My work
    spans from concept to high-fidelity prototypes, visual design, observation and reporting
    of any pre-production issues, delivering specifications and style guides to the development team, and
    providing feedback during development. I work with the stakeholders and teams daily to create and
    communicate design requirements, and gather feedback for iteration.

    Unfortunately, I am unable to share samples of these projects for confidentiality reasons.
