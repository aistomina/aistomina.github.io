            <h1>Tnings shockingly large and surprisingly small</h1>
            <p>We live in a world where all the objects have a certain size, and we accept that size unconditionally - it is what it is.
        We expect all familiar objects to be a certain size. What if all of a sudden all the objects started changing their size - would that create total chaos?
        Would it be a crazy world to live in if there wre more objects that didn't fit it the "normal range"?

            <h2> Here is a photo of a shockingly large turtle I once saw in Hawaii</h2>
            <p>I asked local people why there was a huge turtle in the volcano crater, but nobody could really tell me. Neither did anyone know where it came from, and how it got it.
                I marveled at this magnificent creature a while longer, then I had to go eat lunch. I hope one day to see the turtle again.

            <h2>Once Upon a Time in the Woods</h2>
            <p>I had a curious encounter with a surprisingly small creature.
                He looked like a little boy, only very, very small. "Hello, little boy! I really like your hat!" - I said. But he didn't acknowledge me, and just kept going somewhere among the fallen pine cones.
                I will never know why that boy was so small and where he was heading - but I will ever forget him.
