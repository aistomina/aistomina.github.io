  <h1>Ragdoll Breeder Mobile Site</h1>

  <p>
    A mobile site that helps Ragdoll cat breeders effectively present their available cats and share information with potential buyers about pricing, cat care, application process, etc. Potential cat buyers are able to see information about available cats, view their photos and get information necessary for purchasing a cat from the breeder.

  <h1>Competitive Analysis</h1>

  <p>
    Most current ragdoll sites in the area are not mobile optimized or have good information architecture. They are mostly designed to the seller’s taste, and do not target the buyers well.
  </p>
  <p>
    A lot of times the photos and cat information is not displayed in an effective or pleasing way. Photos are hard to view.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sometimes important  information is hard to find, and the sites are too noisy.
  </p>
  <p>
    I will attempt to make a site that is mobile friendly. The information is well organized and easy to find. The cats are displayed properly. The site is delightful and appeals to both hip/tech savvy adults, families and kids.

  <h1>Usability Test Plan</h1>
</div>

<div class="accordion">
  <h3>
    Usability Goals
  </h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      The main tasks that the website prototype was designed to support are:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>providing information on cats available for purchase</li>
      <li>providing information about specific cats (cat bios) and prices</li>
      <li>providing information about the breeder</li>
      <li>providing information about how to contact the seller</li>
      <li>display clients testimonials</li>
      <li>support the brand by presenting the breeder site as a professional, trustworthy, hip and pleasant place to visit. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      With that in mind, I decided to focus on two major usability goals:
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Efficiency</b> - how productive can the users be on the site, how easily and quickly can they find information, and the quality of information.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Satisfaction</b> - how pleasant is the site to interact with, and how satisfied the users are with the site overall, including visual appeal.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3>
    Specific measurements to be taken
  </h3>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Completion rate</b> - a task is considered complete if the participant successfully completes the task without critical errors. If the participant requires assistance to correctly finish the task, it will be considered a critical error. A completion rate of 100% is the goal for each task.</li>
      <li><b>Number of errors per task</b> - number of non-critical errors  per participant per task. A non-critical error is an error that will not affect the outcome of the task, but will affect the efficiency of the task completion.  80% error-free rate is the goal for each task. </li>
      <li><b>Length of time to complete each task</b> - the time from the beginning of the task, to the time when the participant signals completion/failure to complete. </li>
      <li><b>Subjective report on satisfaction and  suggested improvements by the user</b> - post-testing questionnaire will cover this portion.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h3>
    What and how to test
  </h3>
  <div>
    <ol>
      <li>Initial reaction to the website, exploration and reporting on what the user thinks the site is about and what it does.</li>
      <li>Completing specific tasks scenarios</li>
      <li>Getting subjective verbal option, and through a questionnaire</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      The sessions will be completed with 3 participants total, in 3 separate one-on-one sessions.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3>
    Usability tasks and scenarios
  </h3>
  <div>
    <ol>
      <li>Please take a look at the Home page, without clicking anything, and tell me in a few sentences what you think the site is about, and what you could do on the website. </li>
      <li>You would like to see if there are any cats available - you are interested in kittens and possibly adult cats. Please go on the website and find this information.</li>
      <li>You are interested who the breeder is and what their philosophy and policies are. </li>
      <li>You want to find out how much the cats cost .</li>
      <li>You have found a kitten you like and are ready to purchase.  Please find a way to do it. </li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <h3>
    Post-testing questionnaire
  </h3>
  <div>
    <img style="display: block; height: 774px;" src="images/rags/testing-questionnaire.jpg">
  </div>

  <h3>
    Methodology and procedure
  </h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      The testing will have 3 participants. The site prototype will be tested on an Android phone (Pixel).  First impressions, demographic data, satisfaction assessment and suggestions for improvement will be collected via questions, tasks, and a questionnaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      There will be one facilitator, myself. I will also be taking notes. After the brief introduction and ice-breaking, I will ask the participants to carry out the “first impression“ part of the testing. We will then proceed to the task completion. After the tasks, I will ask them to fill out a brief electronic questionnaire form.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3>
    Participants
  </h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      The testing will have 3 participants.  They were recruited from the pool of friends and family, due to budget constraints. Since most of my friends and family love cats, it wasn’t hard to find ones that fit the personas from my market research.
    </p>

    <h4>Participant 1:</h4>
    <p>
      A hip, single female, in her late 20s. She lives by herself and is thinking of getting a cat. She is a chemist, and has a mid-range income. She is a power Internet user.
    </p>

    <h4>Participant 2:</h4>
    <p>
      A  male in his early 30s, working in the tech industry, mid to high income. He has a wife and a young child. The child has been asking to get a cat as of late. He is a power Internet user, and is always busy with work. He is decisive, and doesn’t plan to spend too much time on looking for the right breeder. He does, however,  want to feel good about spending 1K on a cat.
    </p>

    <h4>Participant 3:</h4>
    <p>
      A retired single female, in her late 50s. She loves Ragdolls. If she was ever to purchase one, she would take her time and spend a lot of time on research. Her Internet skills are below average and she often gets lost on sites with poor organization.

  <h1>Usability Test Results</h1>
</div>

<div class="accordion">
  <h3>
    Specific measurements taken
  </h3>
  <div>
    <h4>Completion rate</h4>
    <p>
      A completion rate of 100% has been achieved for every task, which meets the established goal of 100%.
    </p>

    <h4>Number of errors per task</h4>
    <p>
      100% critical error-free rate  - meets the established goal of 100%
    </p>
    <p>
      90% non-critical error rate - exceeds the established goal of 80%
    </p>

    <h4>Length of time to complete each task</h4>
    <p>
      13.7 seconds was the average task completion rate, ranging from 10 seconds to 1 minute.  One of the participants had only limited experience in using the web, the second one was an average proficiency user, and the third was a power user.
    </p>

    <p>
      Subjective report on satisfaction and  suggested improvements by the user will be summarized in the questionnaire results
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3>
    What was tested
  </h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      Initial reaction to the website, exploration and reporting on what the user thinks the site is about and what it does.
    </p>

    <p>
      Participants were all asked to take an initial look at the Home page and tell what the site was about, and what tasks they could perform.
    </p>

    <p>
      All participants easily recognized that the site dealt with cats - either adoptions or sales.
    </p>

    <p>
      The tasks that they thought they could perform on the site were as follows:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>view available kittens</li>
      <li>view available adult cats</li>
      <li>read testimonials</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Summary: Overall, participants had no difficulty recognizing the brand and the purpose of the site. However, their knowledge is limited without having to unfold the navigation menu. They knew the site was about getting a cat - not sure, however, if it was adoption or sales. The name RAGS wasn’t clear enough on its own. Improvements will be suggested.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3>
    Usability tasks and scenarios
  </h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      1. You would like to see if there are any cats available - you are interested in kittens and possibly adult cats. Please go on the website and find this information.
      This task was completed error-free, completion rate 100%. All participants were able to look up available kittens and adult cats from the Home page buttons. All participants ignored the hamburger menu for this task completion.
      Average time spent on task was 10 seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Summary</b>: Overall, this was an easy task, and all users completed it efficiently, since this was the most prominent information on the Home page.
    </p>

    <p>
      2. You are interested who the breeder is and what their philosophy and policies are.
      The task was completed error-free, completion rate 100%. Average time spent on task was 20 seconds (including some reading to make sure this is the right page).
      One participant had mild difficulties with finding the information, and scrolled for it on the Home page, then tried testimonials, and only then the About page.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Summary</b>: Despite the 100% completion rate, this task uncovered a potential problematic area. Improvements will be suggested.
    </p>

    <p>
      3. You want to find out how much the cats cost .
      The task was completed error-free, completion rate 100%. Average time spent on task was 15 seconds.
      This task revealed several problems. All participants wanted to see the price for each cat right underneath their photo, along with the cat name and age. The pricing page wasn’t clear enough, and one participant expressed a need for a clear list-like price list.
      All participants were able to find the Pricing page with ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Summary</b>: Despite the 100% completion rate, this task uncovered some potential problematic areas with information availability and placement. Improvements will be suggested.
    </p>

    <p>
      4. You have found a kitten you like and are ready to purchase.  Please find a way to do it.
      The task was completed error-free, completion rate 100%. Average time spent on task was 10 seconds.
      All participants were able to find the Contact page with ease. However, one was reluctant to proceed with the form without knowing exactly how much the cat cost. One tried to click the email address in the footer to email the seller.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Summary</b>: Despite the 100% completion rate, this task uncovered some potential problematic areas with information availability. Improvements will be suggested.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3>
    Post-testing questionnaire
  </h3>
  <div>
    <ol>
      <li>The site was easy to use: 2 Agree, 1 Strongly Agree</li>
      <li>The site was useful: 2 Strongly Agree, 1 Agree</li>
      <li>I was satisfied with the overall experience: 3 Agree</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <h3>
    Additional participant feedback
  </h3>
  <div>
    <ol>
      <li>The Home page, at the first glance, could be more clear about it selling Ragdoll breed cats.</li>
      <li>Some photo heavy pages, like Available Kittens and Available Adults have photo headers that appear to be clickable, when they are not. For example, About page is ok with such a header because its content is mostly text. The photo pages with photo header a bit confusing.</li>
      <li>One broken link found - Pricing page in Nav menu led to About page</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <h3>
    Suggested improvements based on testing
  </h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      Based on the task completion data, and the questionnaire, here are some improvements that would take the site from good to, hopefully, great:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Improve Home page by adding a tagline that will clarify that the site is selling Ragdoll cats, at a glance.</li>
      <li>Remove photographic headers from image heavy pages, to avoid confusion.</li>
      <li>Place a price tag for each cat on the cat bio page.</li>
      <li>Have the email in the footer be clickable for fast emailing.</li>
      <li>Put more information about the breeder on the Home page.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</div>
